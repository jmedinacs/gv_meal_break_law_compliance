# Golden Valley Software – Meal Break Compliance Evaluation

## California Meal Break Law Overview

Under **California Labor Code § 512(a)** and applicable **Wage Orders**:

- An employer **may not employ any employee** for a work period of **more than five (5) hours** per day **without providing a 30-minute unpaid, duty-free meal period**.
- The **meal break must begin before the end of the fifth hour** of work.  
  ⤷ In practice, this means **the lunch break must begin no later than 4 hours and 59 minutes after clock-in**.

**Example:**  
If an employee clocks in at **8:00 AM**, their lunch must begin **by 12:59:59 PM** to comply.

### Waiver Clause
- A **first meal period may be waived** **only** if:
  1. The total shift duration is **no more than six (6) hours**, **and**
  2. The **employee voluntarily consents** to waive the meal period.

Waivers must be **signed** and **retained** for audit or legal review.

This compliance evaluation software uses these standards to detect:
- On-time lunches
- Late lunches without waiver
- Late lunches with waiver (allowed, but tracked)
- Missed lunches

These outputs are compiled monthly and year-to-date to aid HR policy reviews and proactive compliance.
